            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF CORPORATIONS.</head>
            <p>VVHEREAS most Corporations in <hi>England</hi> have, in Persuance to the TEST-ACT of the 25th of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II, turned several Members of their respective Corporations out of their Offices, for not qualifying themselves, as that Act directs; and have elected and admitted new Officers into their Places, who have qualify'd themselves according to that Law, which is known to be the only Bulwark that secures the Church of <hi>England</hi> against all its Enemies; and was eminently known to be serviceable against the Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the late Reign. And whereas in the Votes of <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the sevent Day of <hi>March,</hi> there is a Clause ordered to be added to the Bill, to prevent Disputes that may arise by Members of Corporations, having neglected to sign the Association in due time, for indemnifying such Members of Corporations as neglected to qualifie themselves according to that Law.</p>
            <p>Its humbly conceived, That such Clause, if is passes into an Act, will be highly prejudicial, not only to all Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to the Law if self, in the following Instances, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st. It will vacate all that has been done in Corporations upon that Act, and will re-instate all that have been turned out of their Offices for their Disobedience thereto.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It will turn out all such other Members as have been elected and admitted into their Places, and qualify'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves according to Law; and will thereby cast a publick Odium and Reflection on such Persons as if they were Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, though they have been guilty of no Crime, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themselves to the Laws of the Realm.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It will greatly tend to the weakening that good and wholsome Law; and will, in all probability, incourage Persons to decline complying with the Directions of it; and may in time render that Law Useless, which at present, is the greatest Security and Preservation of our Church and Nation.</p>
